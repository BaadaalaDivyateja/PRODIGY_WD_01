# PRODIGY_WD_01: Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation Menu

## Task Overview

This project is part of Task-01 of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The objective is to create an interactive navigation menu with a fixed position that changes color or style when scrolling or hovering over a menu item. The webpage is designed to be visually appealing, with images related to health and the environment, and responsive on various devices.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu changes colors based on the section of the page you are viewing and provides a hover effect for enhanced user interactivity.
- **Smooth Scrolling and Transitions**: Each section of the webpage slides smoothly into view when scrolling, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Catchy Image Placement**: Images are strategically placed with hover effects and smooth animations to draw attention to the content.
- **Back to Top Button**: A floating button that allows users to quickly navigate back to the top of the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the elements, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, smooth scrolling, and section animations.
